---
What is Software Architecture?
---

Definition: "The set"



---
Architectural Design
---

understanding how a system should be organized and desiging the overall structure of that system

Note: agile processes -- done in early stage of developemtn (eg sprint 0 or before)

	- increemental development of architecture is not usually ...

1 or two images

note that software design took it's pattern and formulation from that of structural architecture.

---
Software architecture
---

Important because it affects the performance, robustness, distributabity of a system.

	- functional req depend on components
	- non-functional reqs -- largely  depend on the system archetecture


---
models of models
---

a model is an abstract view of a system. it ignores some system details, but emphasiszes the overall critical elements of the system structure.

example types of models

- context models
- interaction models
- structural models
- behavioral models

Context Models

footnote on UML

the unified modeling language (UML) is a general purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engin that is inteded to...

---
exercise
---

look at the given models and pick one that works for fleshing out product concept.

this will be a  part of the presentaion on 2-14 (valentine's day)

---
follow-up
---

- As a team summarize the reqs information collected and prioritize. note down the rationale for the prioritization. Note: there will be a  class time to do some of this.
- build a prioritized set of requirements (functional and non-funct, in the format provided in ch 4 of sommerville) to capture what should be done for the design as well as possible constraings.
- write at least one scenario (see ch. 4.10 and the lecture notes) that represetns one of the ost important ways a user ight use your product (and why) given what you learned in the req/needs collection process.
- Each member of the team should write at least one functional and one non-funct structured spec that would need to be met to deliver the scenario. 
- collect the observations on interviewing,  the summary of the prioritized use9r needs reqs (funct and non), your scenarios, and each person's structured specs (id who wrote them) into a single document, and submit them by 2-16
