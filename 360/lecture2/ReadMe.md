10 Large Scale IT Project (bulb)
---

#### McKinsey & Company Report (2012) 

- IT Project (with budgets > $15million in 2010 dollars): 5,400 IT projects studied
  - 45%:	Cost Overrun (~$66 billion)
  - 7%:	Schedule Overrun
  - 56%:	Benefits shortfall (i.e. delivering  56% less value than predicted)
- In 45% of IT Project Cost Overruns:
  - 13%: Missing Focus		
  - 9%: 	Content Issues
  - 6%:	  Skill Issues			
  - 11%:	Execution (e.g., scheduling)
  - 6%:	  Unexplained

---
11 IT Project Statistics
---

- One in Six IT projects have an average cost overrun of 200%, and a schedule overrun of 70% (HBR, 2011)
- The United States economy loses $50 - $150 Billion per year due to failed IT Projects (Gallup Business Review, 2012)
  - More than 200% of Luxembourg GDP
- Fewer than a third of all projects were successfully completed on time and on budget (Standish Group 2013)

Financial Industry (Banking, Mobile Payment), e-Commerce
Tele-Communication, Government
Medicine, Education
Others
Software errors and vulnerabilities can be costly and fatal:
Loss of Money
Impact on Lives: e.g. Navigation, IoT in Medical Devices

---

14 SOFTWARE ENGINEER: PROFESSIONAL ISSUES AND CONCERNS
---


---
15 insights.dice.com/d3/skills-heat
---


---
16 ISSUES AND CONCERNS
---

- Ethics
- Liability, Quality, and Responsiveness
- Protection of Intellectual Property

---
17 ACM/IEEE Code of Ethics
---

- The professional societies in the US have cooperated to produce a code of ethical practice.
- Members of these organisations sign up to the code of practice when they join.
- The Code contains eight Principles related to the behaviour of and decisions made by professional software engineers, including practitioners, educators, managers, supervisors and policy makers, as well as trainees and students of the profession. 

<img src="../ref.png" width="30" height="30" />

---
18 THE ACM/IEEE CODE OF ETHICS 
---

> Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice
> 
> ACM/IEEE-CS Joint Task Force on Software Engineering Ethics and Professional Practices
>  
> PREAMBLE
> Software engineers shall commit themselves to making the analysis, specification, design, development, testing and maintenance of software a beneficial and respected profession. In accordance with their commitment to the health, safety and welfare of the public, software engineers shall adhere to the following Eight Principles:
 



---
19 ETHICAL PRINCIPLES (bulb)
---
 
1. PUBLIC - Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest.
2. CLIENT AND EMPLOYER - Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer consistent with the public interest.
3. PRODUCT - Software engineers shall ensure that their products and related modifications meet the highest professional standards possible.
4. JUDGMENT - Software engineers shall maintain integrity and independence in their professional judgment.
5. MANAGEMENT - Software engineering managers and leaders shall subscribe to and promote an ethical approach to the management of software development and maintenance.
6. PROFESSION - Software engineers shall advance the integrity and reputation of the profession consistent with the public interest.
7. COLLEAGUES - Software engineers shall be fair to and supportive of their colleagues.
8. SELF - Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession.

##### Extra Slide Notes

Which do you think may be the hardest to uphold in your professional life?  Why?

Note that corporations also have policies and ethical principles.

Press issues of bias, harassment, transparency about slowing down your old iPhone, Facebook and Twitter algorithms, etc.

20 GROUP DISCUSSION EXAMPLES
---

<ol>
  <li>The VP of the engineering organization has issued a memo requiring AWS as a platform, despite the team’s exhaustive analysis that the resulting system will not meet the customer’s needs.</li>
  <li>You have been assigned to a team working on a new military drone system to build an autonomous weapon that will act without human intervention.</li>
  <li>Your product manager has determined that the software system that will be used to control hospital operations has to come in on time and on budget no matter what.</li>
  <li>A cloud based collaboration tool will not be made accessible to people with disabilities because the market isn’t large enough.</li>
</ol>

---
21 SOFTWARE ENGINEERING ETHICS
---

- Software engineering involves wider responsibilities than simply the application of technical skills.
- Software engineers must behave in an honest and ethically responsible way if they are to be respected as professionals.
- Ethical behaviour is more than simply upholding the law but involves following a set of principles that are morally correct.

---
22 RELATED ISSUES DISCUSSION
---

- Competence 
  - Engineers should not misrepresent their level of competence. They should not knowingly accept work which is outside their competence.
- Confidentiality 
  - Engineers should normally respect the confidentiality of their employers or clients irrespective of whether or not a formal confidentiality agreement has been signed.


---
23 EXERCISE: GROUP FORMING
---

- 4 Students per Group
- Please POST on the class discussion board:
  + One posting per group
  + Group Name
  + Names (Last Name, First Name) of Your Group Members


---
24 EMPOYEE CONTRACTS: THE FINE PRINT (bulb)
---

- Non-Disclosure Agreements (NDA)
  + Protects trade secrets, sales, and other proprietary information
- Non-Compete Agreements
  + One party (usually the employee) agrees not to compete with another party (usually the employer)
- “Work for Hire” – Vendor, Contractor
  + Assigns ownership/non-ownership of work products
  + May include prior disclosure exhibits

##### Extra Slide notes

What is the challenge?  When you move to a new job?  How do you handle it?

Note tools for companies to protect themselves.  Automatic searches and monitoring traffic.

Work for hire – freelancers or contractors

  + System Certifications (e.g., Oracle)
  + Software Developer Certifications (e.g., IEEE Software)
  + Software Language Certifications (Industry)
  + Academic Certifications
  + Licensing (controversial, see the Texas Board of Professional Engineers)
  + Special Areas (e.g., 6 Sigma, Agile)
  + Continuing Education


---
26 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (IP)
---

An individual / organization can have specific property rights on the intangible intellectual property
- E.g. right to copy, use, change, distribute, or prevent others from doing so

_**Does IP help innovation or hurt it?**_

<img src="../keyword.png" width="30" height="30" />

#### Extra Slide Notes

Does IP help innovation or hurt it?

Bell Labs and cheap licensing
Ameritech and Microsoft – defensive protection; and defensive publication – patent troll phenomenon
Shifting landscape – harder to get some kinds of ideas protected, cost to maintain a patent, so companies are starting to release patents for anyone to use
More dynamic world where a product or service might be constructed with other people’s protected components or systems, open source, and then proprietary/patented components
What Chesbrough calls Open Innovation

Note Corporate IP Protection Technologies
Note Philosophy of Open Source vs. Protected Code vs. Mixed
Note Open Innovation
Note Costs and Time
Note changing legal environment
Expirations
Maintaining IP

27 IP contd. 
---

In the US, IP is defined by:

- Copyrights – for a specific original expression of an idea
- Patents – for an invention (incl. design patents)
- Trade dress – for distinctive product packaging
- Trade secret – for an idea kept confidential
- Trademark – for a symbol, image, or phrase identifying the origin of products

##### Bonus slide notes

Note patent board, generic architecture, business case/trading issues, etc.
Also design patents.

Note telephone keys, that was standardized through an international standards body
The time passing donut could have been protected as a design patent, but part of why it spread was it was given away so no one could patent anything close to it

Standardizing the trash can
NeXT (Steve Jobs) created a black hole. That was design patented, and there COULD have been a functional patent developed if it had richer functionality

Company rewards and encouragement – filing, and then granting several years later
Part of performance review, fairly low barrier to submit typically, though a fair amount of work to refine with the lawyers

Lund Examples, and Wind Farm Story
