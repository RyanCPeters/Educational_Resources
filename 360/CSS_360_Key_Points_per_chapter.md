Ch. 9 Key Points
- Software development and evolution can be thought of as an integrated, iterative process that can be represented using a spiral model.
- For custom systems, the costs of software maintenance usually exceed the software development costs.
- The process of software evolution is driven by requests for changes and includes change impact analysis, release planning, and change implementation.
- Legacy systems are older software systems, developed using obsolete software and hardware technologies, that remain useful for a business.
- It is often cheaper and less risky to maintain a legacy system than to develop a replacement system using modern technology.
- The business value of a legacy system and the quality of the application software and its environment should be assessed to determine whether a system should be replaced, transformed, or maintained.
- There are three types of software maintenance, namely, bug fixing, modifying software to work in a new environment, and implementing new or changed requirements.
- Software reengineering is concerned with restructuring and redocumenting software to make it easier to understand and change.
- Refactoring, making small program changes that preserve functionality, can be thought of as preventative maintenance.
