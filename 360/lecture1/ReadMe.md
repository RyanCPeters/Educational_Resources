24 ADVICE FROM PAST STUDENTS
---

“Keep up with readings and lectures--and you will be fine!”

“A good group dynamic goes a long way.  I really enjoyed my team.”

“STUDY!!!”

“Start the assignments early, even if they seem small. Life can get in the way quite quickly.”

“Don't miss a class.  Discussions contribute as much to the learning process as the slides themselves do.”

“Study in groups for tests is very effective.”

How do you define software engineering?

- Write your definition down and discuss this with 1 or 2 of your neighbors in the class.  Do they agree with you?

![](./images/slide36_image.png)

---
37 EXERCISE
---
Does software programming equal software engineering?  Why or why not?

Discuss this with 1 or 2 students in the class.

39 WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?
---

“A discipline that deals with the building of software systems that are so large or so complex that they are built by a team or teams of engineers” (Ghezzi, Jazayeri, Mandrioli)

“Multi-person construction of multi-version software” (Parnas)

“Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.”  — (Sommerville Ch.1)

44 A BRIEF HISTORY
---

- Software engineering – late 1960s
- Goal is to address the problems of building large software systems
- Software crisis - software projects that are over budget, behind schedule and that missed the mark
  - But this is not a temporary problem, but an inherent difficulty in building new and complex applications
