CLASS ATTENDANCE AND THE BOOK
Topics covered in class are not necessarily in the book
Other reading materials assigned
Class time focusing on the core ideas
The book has detail, and key is to know when and where to find it
Come to class prepared to discuss what you have read


OTHER EXPECTATIONS
Students are expected to spend an average of 10 to 15 hours a week outside of class time for CSS 360.
All University of Washington students are expected to conduct themselves as responsible members of the academic community. Among the standards of conduct for UW students includes the responsibility to practice "high standards of academic and professional honesty and integrity."  WAC 478-120-020(2) (a).
Please read the student conduct code at:
http://www.uwb.edu/academic/policies/academic-conduct
IN THE CLASSROOM
If you attend class, please pay attention to the class.
If you want to pay attention to other things, please go elsewhere.
Please be respectful and courteous to others.
No social networking, games, videos, non-class related mobile phone use.
Practice non-violent communication (online and offline).
Cell Phones in airplane mode.
ADVICE FROM PAST STUDENTS
“Keep up with readings and lectures--and you will be fine!”
“A good group dynamic goes a long way.  I really enjoyed my team.”
“STUDY!!!”
“Start the assignments early, even if they seem small. Life can get in the way quite quickly.”
“Don't miss a class.  Discussions contribute as much to the learning process as the slides themselves do.”
“Study in groups for tests is very effective.”

INTRODUCTION TO SOFTWARE ENGINEERING


CHANGING ROLE OF SOFTWARE
Increasing role of software in all systems
Increase of heterogeneous, networked, distributed, interdependent systems
Implications of failure in these systems
Pervasive collection, manipulation, and use of digital data and information
Importance of software and intellectual property to the economy







EXERCISE:  DEFINE SW ENGINEERING
How do you define software engineering?
Write your definition down and discuss this with 1 or 2 of your neighbors in the class.  Do they agree with you?
EXERCISE
Does software programming equal software engineering?  Why or why not?
CONTRASTS
WHAT IS SOFTWARE ENGINEERING?
“A discipline that deals with the building of software systems that are so large or so complex that they are built by a team or teams of engineers” [Ghezzi, Jazayeri, Mandrioli]
“Multi-person construction of multi-version software” [Parnas]
“Software engineering is an engineering discipline that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of system specification through to maintaining the system after it has gone into use.”  — Sommerville Ch.1


EXERCISE: REFLECTION
What questions do you have about software engineering?

Think silently [1 min]
Share with pair [2 mins]

TYPICAL QUESTIONS
How do you estimate how long something will take?
How do you know who should work on what?
How do you know what needs to be done?
How do you know if you are building the right thing?  The most important thing?
How do you know if you’re building the thing right?
How do you know if what you are working on is “done”?
How do you know what is the most important thing to work on next?
How do you know by when something needs to be done?
How do you know when to no longer support some aspect of a system?
How do you know when to work individually, and when to work in a group?
How do you make the best possible team?
How does the context and environment in which you are operating change the way in which you answer these questions?
A BRIEF HISTORY
Software engineering – late 1960s
Goal is to address the problems of building large software systems
Software crisis - software projects that are over budget, behind schedule and that missed the mark
But this is not a temporary problem, but an inherent difficulty in building new and complex applications 



EXERCISE: GROUP FORMING
4 Students per Group
Please POST on the class discussion board:
One posting per group

Names (Last Name, First Name) of Your Group Members
