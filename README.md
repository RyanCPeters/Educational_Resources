# Educational_Resources
This repository contains lecture notes, exercises, and other such study materials from past and present courses.

### Please note that this page is a work in progress...
As such, it will see more resources added as I get the time or as people choose to contribute their own :)

<p>
<strong>I will be attempting to present the newest course material first</strong>, with the material under each course being presented in chronological order from the start of the cours's term to the end of term.
