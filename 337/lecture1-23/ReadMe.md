2 RSA Public-Key Encryption Algorithm
---

RSA is a block cipher in which the plaintext and ciphertext are integers between 0 and n -1 for some n.

Encryption and decryption are of the following form for some plaintext block `M` and ciphertext block `C`:


`C = M`<sup>e</sup>` mod n`

`M = C`<sup>d</sup>` mod n`

`  = (M`<sup>e</sup>`)`<sup>d</sup>` mod n` 

`  = M`<sup>ed</sup>` mod n`
